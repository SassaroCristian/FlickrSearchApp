# FlickrSearchApp

 Project summary:
    This is a cross platform mobile application built using .Net MAUI, it allows users to search for photos on Flickr using API's.
    The app features a infinite scrolling list to display search results and let's users view the photo in full sceen with additional data.

Key features:
    • Search: Users can search for images based on queries.
    • Infinite scroll: As you scroll throught the photos, more images are loaded dynamically.
    • Full screen view: Clicking an image opens it in full screen with more details.

Dependencies I used:
    • HttpClient: For making requests to the Flickr API.
    • Newtonsoft.Json: To deserialize Json responses from the API.
    • Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration: To read configuration values, including the API key.
